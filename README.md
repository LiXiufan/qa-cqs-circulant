# qa-cqs-circulant
This repository is for numerical experiments of the algorithm solving banded circulant linear systems. The algorithm is developed based on a concept of [classical combination of quantum states (CQS)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ac325f) and with the technique of [quantum Fourier transformation (QFT)](). We use the one-dimensional heat transfer problem as an example of our algorithm. The advantage of the algorithm is that, given the condition number k and the algorithm depth d, it has provable performance guarantees for the truncated error with a threshold polynomial to (d k log(k)).
