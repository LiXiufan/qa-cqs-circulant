# qa-cqs-circulant
This repository is for numerical experiments of the algorithm solving banded circulant linear systems. The algorithm is developed based on a concept of [classical combination of quantum states (CQS)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/ac325f) and with the technique of [quantum Fourier transformation (QFT)](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-computation-and-quantum-information/01E10196D0A682A6AEFFEA52D53BE9AE#overview). We use the one-dimensional heat transfer problem as an example of our algorithm. The advantage of the algorithm is that, given a K-banded circulant matrix and the condition number k_c, it has provable performance guarantees for the truncated error with a threshold polynomial to O(K k_c log(k_c)).
